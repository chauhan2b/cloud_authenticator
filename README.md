This Flutter project aims to provide users with a secure and convenient way to manage their two-factor authentication (2FA) needs. The app allows users to scan QR codes to generate Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) codes, which are securely stored on Firebase. Users can easily access their TOTP codes whenever needed. The app also shares theming options with the news app, including support for dark mode and Material You design language for a personalized experience.
